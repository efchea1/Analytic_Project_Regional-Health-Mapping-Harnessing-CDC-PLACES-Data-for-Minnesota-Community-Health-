# Analytic_Project_Regional Health_Mapping_Harnessing_CDC_PLACES_Data_for_Minnesota_Community_Health_Analysis


Before the CDC PLACES project, the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System BRFSS, allowed for state projected healthcare indicators. This process was not able to be applied to the county level. Now, with CDC PLACES counties can view some projected healthcare indicators. However, currently, the CDC PLACES project does not show in an easy format aggregate county regions. By doing this project, I will help Quin County CHS, other county regions in the state of MN, or even the US.

Project Overview:


Project Name: CDC Places to MN Regions


Objective: Use CDC methodology to create MN Regions for a specific health indicator


Stakeholders: Local public health & Community Health Boards
Data Collection:


Data Sources: Initially, one indicator will be selected from one of the five categories (Health Outcomes, Prevention, Health Risk Behaviors, Health Status, & Disability).
PLACES: Local Data for Better Health: Compare Counties | PLACES | CDC


Data Storage: Once the indicator is selected, data will be stored on GitHub as a CSV so it can be pulled into R without storing it on a local computer.
Data Preparation:


Data Cleaning: Data should be relatively clean (check for duplicates).
Data Exploration: Determine the variables included in CDC’s health care indicator result.
Feature Engineering: If it is possible to reproduce, CDC’s health care indicator, create MN regions using the second bullet point methodology


Using the Data | PLACES: Local Data for Better Health | CDC
Data Modeling:


Model Selection: Utilize CDC’s methodology for a single county & health care indicator.
Model Evaluation:


If we are close to CDC’s results, we will complete the 1 st part of the project.
We will proceed to create MN regions for the 2 nd part of the project.

### Technologies Used:

**R Programming:** For data analysis and modeling.

**ShinyLive in R:** To develop interactive dashboards for dynamic data visualization and narrative generation.
Data Visualization:


Visualization Tools: Dashboard will be created with shinyLive in R
Insight Generation: A dynamic narrative will be created
