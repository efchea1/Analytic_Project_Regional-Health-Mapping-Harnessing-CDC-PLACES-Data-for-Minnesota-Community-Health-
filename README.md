# Analytic_Project_Regional Health_Mapping_Harnessing_CDC_PLACES_Data_for_Minnesota_Community_Health_Analysis


Before the CDC PLACES project, the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System BRFSS, allowed for state projected healthcare indicators. This process was not able to be applied to the county level. Now, with CDC PLACES counties can view some projected healthcare indicators. However, currently, the CDC PLACES project does not show in an easy format aggregate county regions. By doing this project, I will help Quin County CHS, other county regions in the state of MN, or even the US.

### Project Overview

This project utilizes the CDC PLACES data to develop a comprehensive view of health indicators at the county level in Minnesota, surpassing the limitations of the previous CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) which only allowed state-level projections. Our goal is to create actionable insights for public health interventions and resource allocation across Minnesota counties, including Quin County CHS, enhancing public health response capabilities at a local level.

### Objectives:

**Develop Regional Health Models:** Utilize CDC methodologies to analyze health indicators specific to Minnesota counties.

**Enhance Data Accessibility:** Improve the format and accessibility of health data for easier analysis and application at the county level.

### Methodology:

**Data Sources:** Initially, one indicator will be selected from one of the five categories (Health Outcomes, Prevention, Health Risk Behaviors, Health Status, & Disability).
PLACES: Local Data for Better Health: Compare Counties | PLACES | CDC

**Data Integration:** Collect data from various CDC PLACES datasets focusing on health outcomes, prevention, behaviors, status, and disabilities.

**Data Management:** Host all datasets on GitHub in CSV format, enabling seamless integration with data analysis tools like R without the need for local storage.

**Data Cleaning:** Data should be relatively clean (check for duplicates).

**Data Exploration:** Determine the variables included in CDC’s health care indicator result.

**Statistical Modeling:** Employ statistical models to replicate and validate CDC's health indicators, adapting them to regional specifics of Minnesota.

**Feature Engineering:** If it is possible to reproduce, CDC’s health care indicator, create MN regions using the second bullet point methodology.

### Stakeholders: 

Local public health & Community Health Boards

**Visualization Tools:** Dashboard will be created with shinyLive in R

**Insight Generation:** A dynamic narrative will be created

### Technologies Used:

**R Programming:** For data analysis and modeling.

**ShinyLive in R:** To develop interactive dashboards for dynamic data visualization and narrative generation.
